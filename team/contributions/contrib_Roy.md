Roy: I set up the firebase database for this project and assign the databse for our data. Our databse mainly consists of messages of the Dining halls and userdata. I also create the community screen and the chats for four dining halls that allow users to connect with each other. Meanwhile, I also set up firebasehelper to help other screens fetching data from firebase. For the contribution graph, though I have the most contributions in pure numbers, it was also related to the fact that I was the one that uploaded the initial project folder. So our team contribution is not that skewed as in the graph, I cannot complete this project without the help of my teammates.
