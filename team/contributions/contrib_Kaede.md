Kaede - I implemented the menu screen to display the dining hall menu data from the UCSB API. I think the main reason why I made the fewest contribution among our teammates was that I was not familiar with GitHub and mostly worked on our project locally. As another cause, I also spent a lot of time learning and devising how to deal with multiple API calls and their data. However, since I completed my tasks assigned by our team, I believe my fewest contribution doesn't mean I made significantly less effort than other teammates.
