### Individual Contribution File
#### Name: Quansen Wang

The main parts of this project I was working on are the UI design and the user profile page. Throughout the developing process, I implemented changing profile pictures function by 
taking a user input and displaying that input on the screen. Also, by working with Roy, I was able to sync the user input with our database.
I spent my first few weeks working on the UI design: the buttom tabs, the icons, etc.
After the MVP, I moved on to the User Profile Page, and I began with the uploading images function. Later on once Ryan completed storing user login status, I was able to display certain information and sync with the database/
Most of the code contributions I made was for the overall user design, especially those before the MVP.
