Ryan: For the contributions graph, I feel the discrepancies that might arise can be attributed to the commits of our numerous nodes and packages at one point. 
For my part, I was mainly focused on researching and looking up packages and other resources that could best fulfill our features. For example, there were not that many tutorials
on how to specifically implement Google OAuth into React Native and even less that seemed to work for our project. So my part was to follow each individual tutorial until I found
one that wroked for our project - which took a lot of effort but that didn't translate into a lot of lines being committed into the project. Another major feature that I worked on
was trying to implement a way to store our local variables and give other parts of our application access to their values. After discussions and research I decided that
implementing a React Redux store would probably be best to not have to rework the other parts of the app already developed. Similarly, the process of looking up Redux tutorials,
finding one that works, and implementing it didn't lead to a lot of lines being committed.
