### Problem Scenario
Currently, there are two existing applications that provide information regarding UCSB Dining Halls: Gogaucho and UCSB Bridge.
However, they only provide the information like name of the food without actual images. Sometimes, the food name looks delicious does not mean the dishes are tasteful.
Therefore, we are trying to build an app that provides rating and comment sections for users to rate the food provided in the dining hall.
Our app will also provide insights for students who are trying to decide which dining hall they want to go to for the next meal.
