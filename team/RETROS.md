## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used: 
* I used the Start/Stop/Continue method in where I began by asking my team what we wanted to start doing. After some discussion, we found that we wanted to all learn more about React Native - but didn't want to watch a hour tutorial everytime. I recommended that we should stop watching ALL of the tutorials and instead to start taking notes on what we watch individually. As a team, we agreed that putting down bullet points and notes for the videos and tutorials we watch/read would allow the other members of our team to more effectively follow our steps. 
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* The retrospective went really well. Our team was able to come together to propose ideas and solutions freely and came together to brainstorm the best path going forward.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?
* I would advice the next person who leads the retro to not be afraid in guiding the team in discussion. You do not have to force your own thoughts onto the team to guide them in where to go - just a suggestion on what to do and then asking every member on the team on what they think is enough.
