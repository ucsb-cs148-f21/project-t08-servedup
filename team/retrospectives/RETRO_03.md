# Retro #3 <11/17/21>

* Led by: Kaede
* Present: Quansen, Roy, Ryan
* Absent: /

## Action

* Goal: Determine the complete vision of our project toward the Final Release.
* Change: Focus more on the entire picture of our app than our own parts by checking each other's progress.
* Measurement: Achieved if we need less time to confirm our current status to each other.

## More Insights

* Working on a mobile app, not a web app - Pay close attention to what is required for it!

## Retro Assessment

* What retro outline or process you used: 
  * I chose the Start/Stop/Continue outline. We were able to recognize that we need to fully comprehend our app more than before (stop), whereas we should continue the frequent communication of each other's status. After we reflected on our past work, we agreed to decide a more detailed plan for the final phase of our project as what to start from the next sprint.
* How it went:
  * All of us actively discussed how we should move toward the final product and decided what to do next for that goal briefly. Therefore, I can say this retrospective went very well.
* How much any of the Retros changed the way you worked as a team:
  * Retrospectives have helped us to work on our project more productively. They gave us the opportunities to share our idea and concerns about our way of working and allowed us to stay on the same page.
