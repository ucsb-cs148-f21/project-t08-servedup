## Retro Assessment

* Retro Outline:
*   The team leader started the discussion. The discussion begin with a change the team want to make to achieve better workflow. 
*   Then, the team talks about what aspects of the workflow works and should continue
* Everyone participated in the discussion 
* The advice I can give to the next leader is that don't be afraid to start the conversation. The discussion needs a starting point, and it would be nice the leader could start the conversation and set a general goal for the conversation.
