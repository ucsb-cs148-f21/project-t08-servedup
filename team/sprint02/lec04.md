Start our sprint planning

Learning stuffs:
- React Native, general learning (everyone to watch some tutorials)
- UCSB public API (we all need to apply for that)
- Firebase (to store user reviews and ratings)

Assign Issues (posted on github)
- create user stories and link each one to an issue

Create a single database that connects to the frontend
- Using firebase, easiest option to do

Review the code from others and push code to review
- Assign issues to done, and then drag it into review column when ready to review code
